#### Example of EIP712 Signature and Verification

To provide a full example of EIP712 including signature on the client and verification on the smart contract, we can follow the steps outlined below:

1. Define the EIP712 Domain:
   - The EIP712 Domain is a set of parameters that define the context in which the signature is being used. It includes the name, version, chain ID, verifying contract address, and a salt value.
   - Here's an example of how the EIP712 Domain can be defined:
     ```solidity
     struct EIP712Domain {
         string name;
         string version;
         uint256 chainId;
         address verifyingContract;
         bytes32 salt;
     }
     ```

2. Define the Struct for the Data to be Signed:
   - The data to be signed should be structured according to a predefined format. It typically includes the relevant parameters that need to be verified on the smart contract.
   - Here's an example of how the data struct can be defined:
     ```solidity
     struct Transaction {
         address to;
         uint256 amount;
         uint256 nonce;
     }
     ```

3. Generate the Hash of the Data:
   - To generate the hash of the data, you need to concatenate the EIP712 Domain hash with the hash of the data struct.
   - Here's an example of how the hash can be generated:
     ```solidity
     bytes32 hash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
         keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
             "EIP712Domain(string name,string version,uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract,bytes32 salt)",
             keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
                 "MyCrypto", // name
                 "1.0.0", // version
                 1, // chainId
                 address(this), // verifyingContract
                 bytes32(0x76e22a8ee58573472b9d7b73c41ee29160bc2759195434c1bc1201ae4769afd7) // salt
             ))
         )),
         keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
             "Transaction(address to,uint256 amount,uint256 nonce)",
             keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
                 to, // to
                 amount, // amount
                 nonce // nonce
             ))
         ))
     ));
     ```

4. Sign the Hashed Data on the Client:
   - The client-side code should use the user's private key to sign the hashed data.
   - Here's an example of how the data can be signed on the client using MetaMask:
     ```javascript
     const signature = await ethereum.request({
         method: 'eth_signTypedData_v4',
         params: [account, JSON.stringify({ types, domain, primaryType, message })],
     });
     ```

5. Pass the Signature and Data to the Smart Contract:
   - The client should pass the signature and the original data to the smart contract for verification.
   - Here's an example of how the signature and data can be passed to the smart contract:
     ```solidity
     function verifySignature(address to, uint256 amount, uint256 nonce, bytes memory signature) public view returns (bool) {
         bytes32 hash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
             "\x19\x01",
             domainSeparator,
             keccak256(abi.encode(
                 transactionTypeHash,
                 to,
                 amount,
                 nonce
             ))
         ));
         address signer = ECDSA.recover(hash, signature);
         return signer == to;
     }
     ```

6. Verify the Signature on the Smart Contract:
   - The smart contract should verify the signature by recovering the signer's address from the signature and comparing it with the expected signer's address.
   - Here's an example of how the signature can be verified on the smart contract:
     ```solidity
     function verifySignature(address to, uint256 amount, uint256 nonce, bytes memory signature) public view returns (bool) {
         bytes32 hash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
             "\x19\x01",
             domainSeparator,
             keccak256(abi.encode(
                 transactionTypeHash,
                 to,
                 amount,
                 nonce
             ))
         ));
         address signer = ECDSA.recover(hash, signature);
         return signer == to;
     }
     ```

Please note that this is a simplified example to demonstrate the basic steps involved in EIP712 signature and verification. The actual implementation may vary depending on your specific use case and requirements.
